It includes, libs like:

Import cv2

Import numpy as np

Import matplotlib. Pilot as plot

From scrimmage. Util import random_noise

From scrimmage import filters

From scrimmage. Morphology import rectangle

And by those libraries we will do some Spatial Filtering and noise reduction, Also Edge detections
